        <h2>The creature from the woods is stranger than she seems...</h2>
        <p>The animal citizens of Treehollow have discovered a small, strange creature wandering alone in the forest: a
            human child! And they have no idea what it is. Clearly much too young to be on her own, it’s anyone’s guess how
            this mysterious being, named Tamberlane, ended up in their town of Treehollow.</p>

        <p>Fostered by Belfry, the accident-prone bat, and guided by a colorful cast of animal characters, Tamberlane’s
            mysteries continue to unfold. But questions burn in everyone’s minds: who, and what, is she? And could she have
            something to do with the far-off and unspeakable taboo, Abroad?</p>

        <p>An emotionally complex story, Tamberlane is also dedicated to featuring queer characters having adventures that
            have nothing whatsoever to do with the trials and tribulations of their identity.</p>

        <h3>Updates every Wednesday.</h3>
        <p><i>Rated PG13 for themes of xenophobia and childhood neglect.</i></p>

        <h2>An Important Note to All Readers...</h2>

        <p>Caytlin lives with fibromyalgia, a disorder which means she's in varying levels of pain 100% of the time. Her
            health always comes first, and therefore sometimes the comic has to go on brief breaks while she rests and
            recovers. However, Tamberlane is her pride and joy, and she is always passionate about getting pages out as
            quickly and consistently as possible! Thank you for your enthusiasm and patience when she has to rest.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Tamberlane is written and drawn by <b>Caytlin Vilbrandt</b>, a queer, disabled woman from the Pacific Northwest,
                aided by her team of talented individuals. Inspired by the worlds of Beatrix Potter, <em>Redwall</em>,
                <em>The Secret of NIMH</em>, and similar works, Caytlin created <em>Tamberlane</em> as a way to pour her
                childhood love of talking critters into an exciting new adventure.</p>

            <p>In addition to writing and drawing for <em>Tamberlane</em>, she is also an independent illustrator and
                graphic designer. Her previous work includes various fan-made games, comics, and other creations for
                the <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> fandom and webcomics such as <em>Walking on Broken
                Glass</em> and <em>Tar and Feathers</em>.

            <p>Caytlin lives with fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder that impacts her daily life and abilities, but
            does what she can to share her stories with the world as her health allows. In her free time, she enjoys
            spending time with her husband Ryan and her two cats, listening to Broadway musical soundtracks, and
            watching true crime docuseries on Netflix. She also dabbles in game design, web design, and tabletop
            RPGs.</p>

                storytelling, complex characterization, and worldbuilding.</p>

            <p>Originally a singer-songwriter going by the moniker Metajoker, Ari has since expanded into
                scriptwriting and currently works as an independent film producer. His work is heavily influenced
                by fantasy works he enjoyed in his youth, including <i>Redwall</i> and Jeff Smith’s <i>Bone</i>.
                These influences combined with his love of reading have inspired him to create original characters
                with tragic and emotional story arcs.</p>

            <p>As a nonbinary, asexual artist, Ari strives to be an advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community, both in
                his life and his work. He lives with his husband Andy and their feisty feline twins, Charlie and
                Bambi, and their adopted sister Holiday “Holly” Piper Greene. </p>

        <h1>Want to Support the Comic?</h1>
        <p>Monetary support of Tamberlane goes toward our rent and bills and paying my team to help with the production
        of the comic! The more money we make, the more I'm able to pay my team to get pages out faster!</p>

        <div id="support-buttons">
            <div id="patreon-button" class="button"><a href="http://www.patreon.com/tamberlane?utm_source=about">Become a Patron</a></div>
            <div id="coffee-button" class="button"><a href="http://www.ko-fi.com/justcaytlin">Buy the Creator a Coffee</a></div>
        </div>

            <p>Even if you can't support us financially, however, just sharing Tamberlane with your friends and family
                can make a huge difference. Comments, words of support, fanart and other fanworks, and even just
                speculating about the story on the <a href="http://discord.gg/FoxgloveComics">Foxglove Comics Discord</a>
                are wonderful, wonderful things that help keep us going when the creative fuel tank is low.</p>

            <p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the patience and support you've lent me over the years. You
                guys rock!</p>
