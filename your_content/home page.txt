<h1>Fighting with the gods for our dreams, who lost what you lost</h1>
					
		<p>Welcome to Viy Sitante's <em>how can Heaven love me</em>, a funny angst sex-ridden character musing story. Yeah that's right, we won't be giving you a genre here. You either ride or die with the rest of us.</p>
		<p>(We do think it'd be funny if it fits <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/61361/human-inhuman">hysterical realism</a> though.)</p>
		<p>If you like a story that takes across years involving three characters who must come to terms with their desires vs reality, and the consequences of such actions, then welcome.</p>

	 
	 <p><em>how can Heaven love me</em> takes its name from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo83BYcW2DU">the titular song sung by Sarah Brightman and Chris Thompson.</a>

<p><b>dec.29.2023 update:</b> Posted the last chapter of DOPE <a href="dope3.html">over here</a>. Also added another picrew thing over <a href="fun.html">here</a>.
<br>
I will also have to figure out how to add a link to it on here and on my main portfolio but <a href="https://vsitante.itch.io">I also opened an itchio at last!</a> The entire kinktober thing is up as a pdf, feel free to get it if you wish!</p>
<p><b>nov.07.2023 update:</b> Uploaded the entire kinktober batch to the gallery and comics pages. Astemar's hubby has also been added to the <a href="cast.html">characters</a> page <p>
<p><b>sep.05.2023 update:</b> I realized that I should probably have some small update thingeroo. I added more art to the <a href="heart.html">gallery</a>, the <a href="comic.html">short comics</a> I've finished as of recent. and adjusted the <a href="cast.html">characters</a> page a bit. On that last one, I forgot to add Astemar's hubby, so I did that...but I also forgot to draw Ur√°n. D'oh! Next time, I suppose.</p>
