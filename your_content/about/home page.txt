Against a background of different textures with shades of blue, white and purple colors, are three figures. All of them are holding each other in a totem pole-esque manner. The first figure, Astemar, is seated behind the second figure and looking at us with monstrous eyes. We cannot see her expression otherwise. Her upper body appears slightly deformed, given her oddly shaped chest. We can see she's wearing a top cut off at the midriff, as well as wearing boots. One of Astemar's hand is on the second figure's head, gently--while her other hand and arm are around his chest and shoulders. The second figure is Magnus, who's wholly naked. He has his eyes closed as he's tenderly holding onto a small girl, as he's sitting down with his legs bent towards himself. The little girl is Astemar once again, in a turquoise-shaded long sleeved dress. Her eyes are closed as she's resting against Magnus' chest." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/protect%20coloredv6.png"></a>
	
		 <a href="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/collars.png" alt="Color picture. Against a red background that unites with Astemar's long jacket, she and Magnus are kissing, though we see him from behind only. She's inked in red while he's inked in a darker shade of pink. She's dressed in what looks to be a fancy bikini while he's in a simple buttoned shirt and pants. The only black colored thing here are the collars that they're both wearing, and holding onto from each other." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/collars.png"></a>
	
	 <a href="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/aste%20artsyv3.png" alt="Color picture. Against a black background, Astemar is colored blue to indicate a calm state of things. She is laying on her side, semi-curled, though it looks like she's sitting down to us. Her hand's up with intent to possibly cover her face--though it looks as if she's nursing a migraine. Regardless, she's blushing intensely. Her other hand is on her open thigh, possibly hiding the bite marks. There's black fabric draped on her leg, with the other half draped barely around her leg. The latter is bent upwards, with her butt colored red in symbolism of what's happened: white, sticky fluid is coming out of her lady parts." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/aste%20artsyv3.png"></a>

She has on death metal-kind of makeup, with black circles around her eyes that are dripping down her cheeks and onto her clavicle. Her eyes are red glowing yellow. She has elfen ears. Atop her head is a stump breathing fire, while in her hand, she grasps a flaming heart. Naked, her other hand is gently placed near the back of Magnus, who is wrapped around her bottom half. He's looking at us as if we should be jealous he's there. He looks possessive as well. His upper half is naked." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/very%20symbolic%20who's%20the%20monster%20and%20who's%20the%20manv3.png"></a>

There's a woman covering her chest with her hands, as she's kneeling down. She appears to be headless, despite her hair being present--there's a hole where her head should be. Under her hands, between her breasts, peeks out an eye in red and glowing yellow. From her lower half, blood is spilling all over, eventually dripping down from the floor. There's text above and on her. In uppercase/all caps. Text above: I am not an obscure object of desire nor am I a child of man. Text on her: I am a child of god and I have been murdered by man for their pleasure." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/Illustrationv5.png"></a>

She's not exactly on the edge of the bed, but close to it. Her shirt's opened haphazardly to reveal her breasts, and the only other piece of clothing she has on are her socks. Bite marks around one of her breasts and her lower thigh can be seen. She's gripping the bed for dear life. Her husband is kneeling on the floor, fully clothed save for his penis--he has that out and stroking it as he eats his wife out. You see those slippers of his? Straight out of some old movie. He looks at peace being between her legs though. To the corner of the floor, we can see her dress tossed without a thought. The entire picture is in shades of red, to reflect their levels of passion respectively." class="lazy" data-ngthumb="https://vsitante.neocities.org/nanogallery/color/magastev5.png"></a>

Must be a me problem then. Anyway, an attempt: two men in the throes of sex. One's hairier than the other. The hairy one is touching the other's breasts (almost hiding it from us) at the same time as he's teasing him downstairs. The not hairy one still has his shirt on.
